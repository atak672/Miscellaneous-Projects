# Discrete Mathematics Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments from Duke University's **COMPSCI 230 course: Discrete Mathematics**. The assignments focus on applying concepts from discrete math through functional programming in **Scheme**.

Code files include detailed comments explaining the purpose of functions and their logic. Test cases are also provided to validate the functionality and correctness of the implementations.
