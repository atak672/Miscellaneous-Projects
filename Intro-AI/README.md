# Introduction to AI Projects

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from Duke University's **Compsci 370: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Search Algorithms**
- In this assignment, I implemented various search algorithms including breadth-first search, depth-first search, and A* search to solve navigation and puzzle-based problems. The project emphasized optimizing pathfinding and heuristic design.

### 2. **Multi-Agent Search**
- This project explored strategies for multi-agent systems, such as adversarial and cooperative agents. Using techniques like minimax and alpha-beta pruning, I developed agents to play games and navigate competitive environments.

### 3. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Reinforcement Learning**
- I worked with MDPs and reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize decision-making under uncertainty. The assignment involved policy iteration, value iteration, and Q-learning to solve gridworld scenarios and train intelligent agents.

### 4. **Machine Learning**
- The final project introduced machine learning techniques, focusing on supervised learning. Tasks included implementing classifiers like decision trees and perceptrons, as well as experimenting with feature engineering and evaluation metrics.

## Notes
- This repository includes only edited files and does not have all the necessary components to run the projects locally.
